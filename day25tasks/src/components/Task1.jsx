      <p>
        Performance optimization in React helps improve speed, responsiveness, and efficiency by
        reducing unnecessary component renders, optimizing re-renders, and managing heavy
        computations efficiently. This is essential in large-scale applications where performance
        bottlenecks affect user experience.
